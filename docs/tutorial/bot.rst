Create the bot
--------------

To create your bot users go to this `page`_ and enter your bot username. Once this
is done you will be provided with an ``API Token`` (starting with ``xoxb``).

This is your :ref:`authentification` token.

.. _page: ://my.slack.com/services/new/bot

Install Sir-bot-a-lot
---------------------

Next step will be to install `Sir-bot-a-lot`_ in your virtual environment.
First download all the necessary packages.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/pyslackers/sir-bot-a-lot
    $ git clone git://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-plugins
    $ git clone git://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-slack


Then make sure to activate your virtual environment and install the packages.

.. code-block:: console

    $ source .env/bin/activate
    $ pip install sir-bot-a-lot/
    $ pip install sirbot-plugins/
    $ pip install sirbot-slack/

Configuration
-------------

`Sir-bot-a-lot`_ expect your ``API Token`` to be an environment variable. The
easiest way to set it is:

.. code-block:: console

    $ export SIRBOT_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-0123456789

Except the tokens all configuration takes place in the configuration file. It
can be located anywhere in your file system and you need to pass the path as
the ``--config`` argument when starting `Sir-bot-a-lot`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sirbot:
        plugins:                    # Plugins we want to use
            - sirbot.plugins.sqlite # Required but the slack plugins
            - sirbot.slack

    slack:
        priority: 20                # We make sure the slack plugin start after the sqlite plugin
        rtm: true                   # We want to connect to the rtm API

    sqlite:
        file: ':memory:'            # The database will only be stored in memory (default)


Now that we have configured `Sir-bot-a-lot`_ we can start it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sirbot -c path/to/configuration/file

You should now see some logs in your terminal and hopefully the presence status
of your bot will turn green. By default your bot will react to mention
(``@mybot``) with the ``:robot_face:`` emoji.

Responding to message
---------------------

In order to customize the behavior of your bot you need to write your very own
plugin. You can look at the one for the `python developers slack community`_
plugin over `here`_.

For that create a new file named ``my_awesome_plugin.py`` with this small
example plugin that respond ``I'm alive!`` when someone send the message
``@mybot hello`` in a channel your bot is in.

.. code-block:: python

    import re

    from sirbot.core import hookimpl, Plugin

    @hookimpl
    def plugins(loop):
        return MyAwesomePlugin(loop)

    class MyAwesomePlugin(Plugin):

    __version__ = '0.0.1'
    __name__ = 'my_awesome_plugin'

    def __init__(self, loop):
        self._loop = loop
        self._started = True
        self._facades = None

    async def configure(self, config, router, session, facades):
        self._facades = facades

    async def start(self):

        # Get the slack facade to add new message endpoints
        slack = self._facades.get('slack')

        # Register a new endpoints for message matching the 'hello' regex. We
        # also had the 're.IGNORECASE' flag to also match 'Hello', 'heLLo' etc
        # and the we set the mention parameter to True so it will only react
        # when someone @ him or talk in a direct message.
        slack.add_message('hello',
                          self.my_message_response,
                          flags=re.IGNORECASE,
                          mention=True)

        # Our plugin is successfully started
        self._started = True

    @property
    def started(self):
        return self._started

    async def my_message_response(self, message, slack, facades, match)

        response = message.response()       # Create a response from the incoming message
        response.text = '''I'm alive!'''    # Set the response text

        await slack.send(response)          # Send the response

Now that you have created your plugin we need to tell `Sir-bot-a-lot` to load
it. For that we add the import path of your file to the list of plugins.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sirbot:
        plugins:
            - sirbot.plugins
            - sirbot.slack
            - my_awesome_plugin

And since we ask for the slack facade in the configuration we need to edit the
configuration file to make sure ``my_awesome_plugin`` start after slack. For
this we will add the following snippet at the end:

.. code-block:: yaml

    my_awesome_plugin:
        priority: 1

You are now the proud possessor of an awesome slack bot !
